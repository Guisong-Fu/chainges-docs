> **`Google ARCore`** allows you build apps for Android and iOS. With **`Apple ARKit`** you can build apps for iOS; with **`Apple RealityKit`** â€“ for iOS and macOS. And a great old **`PTC Vuforia`** was designed to create apps for Android, iOS and Universal Windows Platform.

What is the difference between **RealityKit** and **ARKit**? 

When I create Xcode AR project, the only option is RealityKit. Is ARKit already obsolete?
