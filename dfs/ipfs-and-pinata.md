## FileCoin vs Pinning Service\(e.g. pinnata\)

My impression by now is that they are kind of two services, running on two networks, FileCoin network and IPFS network.

Q: Am I right of saying that?

## Pinata Feature

It has some cool things like a dedicated **IPFS gateway, a pin explorer, and metadata support so your pins can have human names instead of hashes**. But it's **NOT** decentralised yet. \(what?\)
